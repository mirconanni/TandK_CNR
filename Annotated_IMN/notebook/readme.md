# JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS

I will work with 4 dataset mainly:

- vodafone_zel1_evnt_5min

- vodafone_zel1_evnt_10min

- vodafone_zel1_traj_5min

- vodafone_zel1_traj_10min

The tag 5 or 10 minutes indicates the threshold used to divide two different trajectories.
The raw data were divided in two: an event dataset that contained some metadata about the trip while 
the trajectory dataset contained the coordinates of the locations visited.
